          The artist is the creator of beautiful things. To reveal art and
          conceal the artist is artâ€™s aim. The critic is he who can translate
          into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful
          things.

          The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of
          autobiography. Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are
          corrupt without being charming. This is a fault.

          Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the
          cultivated. For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom
          beautiful things mean only beauty.
